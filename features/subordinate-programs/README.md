# Subordinate Programs

Imagine you want to setup a program that is essentially a duplicate of an already-existing program that you have.

Subordinate programs allow you to make a new program that pulls the children from an existing program and uses them for a new program with the possibility of different settings, donor forms and email templates.

For example, you have a sponsorship program in Haiti that you want to make available for sponsorship in the US and the UK.

Make the initial program settings, donor form, and email templates for the US. Then make a new sub-program and make new program-settings, donor form and email templates that are specific to the UK. Now you can have people in the US and the UK sponsoring from the same pool of children. This setup will work best if your program type is set to 'number of sponsors.'&#x20;

Have a look at this screencast to see how subordinate programs work.
