# Searchable Fields

Inorder to make a field searchable both in the admin section. That is to say the donors and program recipient table as well as the frontend page which the donor views.

In the drawer to either add a new form field or edit a form field, there is an option of  `Title` option for the donor field type and the `Filter?` for recipient field type.\


### Making donor field searchable

In the field type for a donor there is the option to set the field to be a title field\


<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>title</p></figcaption></figure>

In this case you check the title field so that it is the details that is shown about the donor and as well its the field that the search will be determined by.



### Making the recipient fields searchable

In this field type there is an option of making the field filterable, which in the same event makes it searchable.

> Note that this is not present for all field types

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>filter</p></figcaption></figure>

Now when searching, it will only show the results that match the fields that you have defined as searchable in the form fields
