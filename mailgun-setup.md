# Mailgun Setup

In order for system generated emails to be sent from an email address associated with your organization you will need to create an account with Mailgun by going to their website: [http://www.mailgun.com/](http://www.mailgun.com/). We use Mailgun to handle our transactional emails because it provides our clients an inexpensive way to ensure your emails are delivered. Mailgun allows up to 10,000 emails a month for free and beyond that the cost is very cheap.

Once you have created your Mailgun account and logged in click on the URL under the Custom Domains or you can use the Mailgun Subdomains if you don't have a custom domain set up:
