# Select And Search

On the table tools, we offer you the ability to select the program that you want to view from the dropdown options

When you want to search for a recipient, you can leverage our search feature to search for the recipient.

> Only the column headers that are available on the view can be searched, so you cannot search for age when you don't have age among the table column headers.
