The top menu bar includes a notification dropdown, represented by a notification icon. When clicked, this dropdown reveals all the recent activities associated with the specific account. Additionally, there is a user dropdown that displays both the name of the organization to which the current user belongs and the email of the admin currently logged in. Clicking on this triggers a dropdown to appear with various options, such as:

* **Switch theme to dark mode**, which replaces the default light mode with a dark mode.
* An **"Account Settings"** option that leads to the account settings page.
* **"Activity Log"** that leads to the activity log page that displays recent account activities.
* The **"Change Logs"** option, which redirects you to the ongoing updates on the platform.
* The **"Documentation"** option, which takes you to HelpYouSponsor's documentation.
* The **"Sign Out"** option is for logging out of the application.
