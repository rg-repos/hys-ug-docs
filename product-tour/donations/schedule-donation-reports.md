# Schedule Donation Reports

This is a way to schedule donation reports to be received by email.

This can be used to get monthly donation reports.

First of all you'll need to have created saved donation views because they are what will be used to create the donations report\

With saved views then we'll go to the `Schedule Report` tab

In the form you'll view certain input items

**Select Report**; this will be the list of saved donation views. Choose one that you would want to receive email of.

**Select Duration**; here you choose how far back the donations information would have to be backtracked on. For example you want to receive donations in the past 7 days from the current date.

**Select Frequency**; here you choose how often you want to receive the report via email, that's to save monthly, every after 3 months etc.

**Select Start Date**; this will be the first day you would want to receive the email and then the duration and frequency would be applied to it.

Below the form you'll see the `Scheduled Reports` which will list the scheduled reports\
